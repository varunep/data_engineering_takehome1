DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâ€™s 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  New York City has approximately 140,000 catch basins, 114,000 hydrants, 90,000 valves, 14 gatehouses, 3 reservoirs, 68 groundwater wells, a 100 million gallon underground storage tank and 7,000 miles each of both sanitary sewers and water mains. The responsibility of maintaining these vast networks falls under the Department of Environmental Protectionâ€™s Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO).  Plan Review is a unit within the division of Engineering that evaluates civil engineering plans with a potential impact on the New York City water supply and sewer systems. For example, Plan Review analyzes the proposals for the development of private water and sewer infrastructure, large public or private development projects, and green infrastructure projects. The selected candidate will be responsible for reviewing, analyzing, and approving the designs to ensure compliance with DEP standards and engineering practices.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâ€™s 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  New York City has approximately 140,000 catch basins, 114,000 hydrants, 90,000 valves, 14 gatehouses, 3 reservoirs, 68 groundwater wells, a 100 million gallon underground storage tank and 7,000 miles each of both sanitary sewers and water mains. The responsibility of maintaining these vast networks falls under the Department of Environmental Protectionâ€™s Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO).  Plan Review is a unit within the division of Engineering that evaluates civil engineering plans with a potential impact on the New York City water supply and sewer systems. For example, Plan Review analyzes the proposals for the development of private water and sewer infrastructure, large public or private development projects, and green infrastructure projects. The selected candidate will be responsible for reviewing, analyzing, and approving the designs to ensure compliance with DEP standards and engineering practices. The Plan Review group ensures that a network of city infrastructure vital to the continued operation is protected and that service interruption is minimized.  â€¢	Independently utilizes engineering, construction, DEP, and other standards and practices related to hydrology, hydraulics, structural engineering, and geotechnical engineering to analyze plans submitted to the Plan Review unit. This analysis concerns the  impact on the NYC sewer and water supply systems, and the proposed drainage and water supply facilities will be built and/or maintained in conformance with the latest DEP Standards and requirements. For example, we have reviewed the impact of critical NYC projects such as the Second Avenue Subway Expansion, Hudson Yards development, and Gateway tunnel. â€¢	Engages in research of existing water and sewer records, investigation, or studies to determine the extent of sewer infrastructure within the review area. â€¢	Assist the Engineer-in-Charge in meetings with the representatives from other City and State agencies and private filing professionals to explain Plan Review requirements. â€¢	Coordinates verbally via phone and in-person communication to explain Plan Review standards and submission deficiencies to applicants.

DCPâ€™s six strategic objectives include: (a) catalyze long-term neighborhood improvement through integrated planning and targeted accompanying public investments; (b) encourage housing production, affordability, and quality; (c) promote economic development and job growth; (d) enhance resiliency and sustainability of neighborhoods; (e) ensure integrity, timeliness and responsiveness in land use reviews; and, (f) supply objective data and expertise to a broad range of planning functions and stakeholders.  Central to its mission, DCP supports the City Planning Commission in its annual review of approximately 450 land use applications. The Department also works closely with OMB in developing the Ten-Year Capital Strategy, and helping administer the Neighborhood Development Fund, geared toward ensuring that growing neighborhoods undergoing rezoning have accompanying infrastructure investments.  The New York City Department of City Planning is a great place to work â€“ cultivating intellectual inspiration, professional development and creativity. Visit our website at www.nyc.gov/planning to access the full listing of job opportunities and to learn more about our great agency.  THE DIVISION:  Staten Island is home to nearly Â½ million people, and is characterized by its unique geography, including the Serpentine Ridge that traverses much of the island, and natural features such as coastal wetlands and large wooded areas. While the smallest of the five New York City boroughs, the planning issues facing the borough are very similar to those facing other mid-sized cities throughout the rest of the country, including growth management, infrastructure, and affordable housing. While much of the island consists of lower-density â€œsuburbanâ€ communities, there is significant growth underway in the more urban North Shore and throughout the islandâ€™s many traditional town centers. The zoning for the borough is comprised of several distinct special districts, including three that, together, cover the majority of the island and place a large focus on the preservation of natural features.    Working closely with central divisions of the Department of City Planning, the Staten Island Office is responsible for the full range of borough planning activities, including: developing borough-wide and local plans with a focus on growth management, affordable housing, resiliency, natural resource preservation, and transit-oriented development; reviewing and processing land use applications; leading community outreach; planning for resiliency and climate change; and providing technical and policy guidance and direction on all land use and zoning related matters to the City Planning Commission, local Community Boards, elected officials, and the public at large.  THE ROLE:  The agency is seeking to fill the position of Deputy Director of the Staten Island Borough Office to assist the Borough Director to manage a team of planning and urban design professionals with a wide variety of projects and studies, track the Officeâ€™s numerous land use applications, and oversee comprehensive planning efforts.

The amendments to original LL86 increase environmental standards and requirements for City capital and City-owned projects which results in operational and procedural implementation changes for all involved City agencies. New York Cityâ€™s Green Building Laws require certain City capital projects to comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building standards established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), and based on the funding amount that projects reach additional energy cost savings. Under certain conditions future City-owned capital projects are required to be designed and constructed as low energy intensity buildings and net zero buildings.  MOEC is seeking two Policy Advisors to support the implementation process of the Green Buildings Laws. Under supervision of the Deputy Director of MOEC and other staff, the selected candidate will engage in a major effort to redesign and improve the existing Green Buildings law implementation process.

TLC develops and enforces rules to promote safety, transparency, as well as consumer and driver protection for a vital mode of transport in New York City. The vehicles, businesses, and drivers licensed and regulated by the agency move over one million people a day. With the introduction of new apps and technologies, TLC is on the front lines of a changing mobility landscape. To learn more about the TLC, please visit: www.nyc.gov/taxi. In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a joint investigation into predatory practices by brokers in the taxi industry.

The review will also set down strict new rules that prevent broker practices that hurt drivers. TLC is expanding its capacity to conduct ongoing reviews of this nature by starting the Business Practices Audit Unit (BPAU). The units mission is to protect TLC drivers and medallion owners from dangerous and unfair industry practices by businesses that fall under TLC regulation. Working in the Division of Finance and Administration, the BPAU Director will provide leadership and day-to-day management over staff and vendors tasked with increasing accountability and transparency of business practices in the for-hire transportation sector. The Director will collaborate with agency partners to promote sound business practices, and investigate and expose violations of TLC rules and relevant local, state or federal regulations.

Monitor companies suspected of engaging in suspicious practices.  Serve as a subject matter expert in analyzing complex business practices, and lead reviews of external factors impacting the financial stability of the industry (e.g., medallion lending practices). Research the business practices of TLC licensed entities and evaluate risks to the industry.  Direct the activities of a professional staff of investigators, auditors, and contracted vendors engaged in the performance of confidential, highly complex, and/or special investigations involving examinations of records, interviews of subjects and witnesses, and on-site inspections, collaborating as needed with other agencies within the City.  Collect, verify, and analyze documents subject to audit, including TLC data, financial records, public assistance records, and other records derived from law-enforcement databases and City and State agencies. Conduct conflicts of interest reviews of annual disclosure reports.  Direct the BPAU to carry out in-depth reviews that may be required as part of TLC licensing and renewal applications for businesses, as well as medallion transfers. Establish protocols to ensure thorough but timely reviews.  Work with TLC External Affairs to develop an outreach plan to inform TLC drivers and owners of their rights, and to ensure that they know how to contact us and submit a formal complaint for investigation and possible prosecution if they feel they are seeing suspicious or predatory behavior.  Analyze key metrics and develop best practices to guard against predatory lending.
