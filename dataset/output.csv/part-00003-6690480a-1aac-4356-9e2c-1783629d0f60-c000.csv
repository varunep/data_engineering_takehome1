DCPâ€™s six strategic objectives include: (a) catalyze long-term neighborhood improvement through integrated planning and targeted accompanying public investments; (b) encourage housing production, affordability, and quality; (c) promote economic development and job growth; (d) enhance resiliency and sustainability of neighborhoods; (e) ensure integrity, timeliness and responsiveness in land use reviews; and, (f) supply objective data and expertise to a broad range of planning functions and stakeholders.  Central to its mission, DCP supports the City Planning Commission in its annual review of approximately 450 land use applications. The Department also works closely with OMB in developing the Ten-Year Capital Strategy, and helping administer the Neighborhood Development Fund, geared toward ensuring that growing neighborhoods undergoing rezoning have accompanying infrastructure investments.  The New York City Department of City Planning is a great place to work â€“ cultivating intellectual inspiration, professional development and creativity. Visit our website at www.nyc.gov/planning to access the full listing of job opportunities and to learn more about our great agency.  THE DIVISION: Staten Island is home to nearly Â½ million people, and is characterized by its unique geography, including the Serpentine Ridge that traverses much of the island, and natural features such as coastal wetlands and large wooded areas. While the smallest of the five New York City boroughs, the planning issues facing the borough are very similar to those facing other mid-sized cities throughout the rest of the country, including growth management, infrastructure, transportation, and affordable housing. While much of the island consists of lower-density â€œsuburbanâ€ communities, there is significant growth underway in the more urban North Shore and throughout the islandâ€™s many traditional town centers. The zoning for the borough is comprised of several distinct special districts, including three that, together, cover most of the island and place a large focus on the preservation of natural features.

THE POSITION: The Staten Island Office seeks a Senior Borough Planner/Planning Team Leader with a combination of strong technical planning, project management, and communication skills, in addition to an understanding of land use and public policy issues of primary importance to the department, including zoning, urban design, transportation planning, resiliency, affordable housing and economic development.

Its mission is to promote quality housing and diverse, thriving neighborhoods for New Yorkers through loan and development programs for new affordable housing, preservation of the affordability of the existing housing stock, enforcement of housing quality standards, and educational programs for tenants and building owners. HPD is tasked with fulfilling Mayor de Blasioâ€™s Housing New York Plan, which was recently expanded and accelerated through Housing New York 2.0 to complete the initial goal of 200,000 affordable homes two years ahead of schedule by 2022, and achieve an additional 100,000 homes over the following four years, for a total of 300,000 homes by 2026.  * Please note: You must have either taken the Housing Development Specialist (HDS) civil service exam in October 2019, or be permanent in the HDS title, in order to apply for this position.

In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 45-day review of practices by brokers in the taxi industry.

The review evaluated whether brokers violated existing TLC rules and recommended policy changes to identify and avoid potential broker conflicts and clarify brokersâ€™ duty to act in the best interest of their clients.

Monitor companies suspected of engaging in suspicious practices. â€¢	Serve as a subject matter expert in analyzing complex business practices, and analyze external factors impacting the financial stability of the industry (e.g., medallion lending practices).  Research the business practices of TLC licensed entities and evaluate risks to the industry.  â€¢	Conduct research and investigations involving examinations of records, interviews of subjects and witnesses, and on-site inspections, collaborating as needed with other agencies within the City. â€¢	Collect, verify, and analyze documents subject to audit, including TLC data, financial records, public assistance records, and other records derived from law-enforcement databases and City and State agencies.

The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $15B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Bureau seeks to hire two Program Managers; one to support the Executive Director of Water System Capital Program and the other to support the Executive Director of Wastewater Capital Program.  BEDCâ€™s Water System Capital Program (WSCP) staff oversee the design and construction of water system capital projects in NYC and within the NYC watershed, which extends 125 miles north and west of the city. These projects may include dams, aqueducts, intake and release facilities, water treatment plants, bridges, roadways, buildings or other miscellaneous infrastructure projects. There is approximately $7M in planned and active construction projects in WSCP.  BEDCâ€™s Wastewater Capital Program (WWCP) staff oversee the design and construction of all capital projects managed by the bureau, on behalf of the Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT), as well as the design and construction of wastewater resource recovery facilities for the Bureau of Water Supply (BWS). Currently, WWCP manages 14 resource recovery facilities and 95 pump stations within the City and several plants throughout the NYC watershed.  Capital Projects delivered for BWT include the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Abatement program; the Gowanus Superfund Tanks, Sewage Treatment Plant & Pumping Station Upgrades and/or Expansions; and Landfill Remediation work. Additionally, WWCP includes over $6 billion in active work, and approximately $300 million to $500 million in new work, annually. WWCP consists of a group of approximately 80 project managers and engineers who manage capital projects consistent with Bureau project delivery and construction management procedures, with an emphasis on safety, scope, schedule, budget and client service.   Under general direction, the Program Managers will coordinate, plan and assist in developing strategies, to advance service delivery and program operations for the $7 billion of water system and $6 billion of wastewater capital construction projects.

NYCHA plans to convert 62,000 apartments over 10 years, which will address $12.8 billion of capital needs. 2)	Build to Preserve (BTP) â€“ New mixed-income buildings will be constructed on some underutilized spaces across the NYCHA portfolio.  NYCHA expects to address $2 billion in capital need across approximately 10,000 apartments.  3)	Transfer to Preserve (TTP) â€“ NYCHA will sell a portion of its estimated 80 million square feet of unused development rights (â€œair rightsâ€) to adjacent privately-owned sites.  TTP will generate $1 billion for capital repairs at adjacent developments.  To support execution of NYCHA 2.0, REDD is seeking a Managing Director of Operations.
