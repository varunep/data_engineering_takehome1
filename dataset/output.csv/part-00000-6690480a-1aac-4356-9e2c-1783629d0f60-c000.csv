Our mission is to protect public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. Every day, DEP delivers more than 1 billion gallons of the highest quality drinking water to nine million New Yorkers, and treats more than 1.3 gallons of wastewater to protect the environment and the NYCâ€™s surrounding waterways. DEPâ€™s vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost-effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation.  The values we embrace in performing our day-to-day work are safety, service, support, transparency, innovation, diversity and sustainability.    We are seeking to fill the position of Deputy Commissioner (DC) of the Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO). This position oversees the maintenance and operation of DEPâ€™s extensive water, sewer and drainage systems, which deliver and collect water through 7,000 miles of water mains and 7,400 miles of sewers. The Bureau is often referred to as the â€œBillboardâ€ of DEP, because its 1,200 employees regularly interface with NYC citizens on streets and in communities throughout the five boroughs. Bureau staff respond 24 hours per day, 7 days a week to calls made to the Cityâ€™s 3-1-1 Call Center on issues related to water and sewer services. Response times and the quality of solutions are key measures in the Mayorâ€™s Monthly Management Report.   The Bureau is also responsible for maintaining more than 109,000 fire hydrants and 148,000 catch basins.  In addition, the Bureau contributes to improving storm water management in NYC through our Green Infrastructure Program by maintaining thousands of curbside rain gardens, referred to as bioswales. This responsibility requires the Bureau to manage the growth of green jobs, which are expected to provide employment and career opportunities to NYC citizens, especially in disadvantaged communities.   An important component of the BWSO DC position is providing leadership and policy direction to the bureauâ€™s staff of managers, engineers, construction laborers, and other operations personnel. Specifically, the selected candidate will be responsible for overseeing:   â€¢	maintenance and repair of the in-City water supply distribution system and sewer drainage system; â€¢	operation of the downstate distribution system that involves in-City chemical treatment plants, reservoirs and pumping stations; â€¢	maintaining appropriate system pressure for delivery of high-quality drinking water to residents and for firefighting; â€¢	overall management of emergency response efforts to water main breaks and street flooding due to weather related conditions and/or drought conditions; â€¢	review, approval and inspection of private connections to NYC-owned water mains and sewer systems; â€¢	operation and maintenance of NYCâ€™s groundwater distribution system that involves ground wells and tanks;  â€¢	implementation of the Bureauâ€™s Environmental Health and Safety Program to ensure that Bureau operations comply with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations regarding the environment and health and safety;  â€¢	accountability for the prudent use of resources including the Bureauâ€™s annual budget of $150 million for operating and $1.1 billion for capital; and  â€¢	development of long-range strategic policies regarding water and sewer infrastructure, ensuring that the Bureauâ€™s capital commitment plan is realized, planning long-range capital needs for  the Bureau and making recommendations to the DEP Commissioner that maximizes the dependability of infrastructure systems.   The selected candidate will be provided with a City vehicle to expedite his/her around-the-clock responses to emergency events.

Almost 400,000 New Yorkers reside in NYCHAâ€™s 325 public housing developments around the five boroughs, and another 235,000 receive subsidized rental assistance in private homes through the NYCHA-administered Section 8 Leased Housing Program.  In 2016 NYCHA released the NextGeneration NYCHA Sustainability Agenda, the Authorityâ€™s 10-year plan to improve energy efficiency and shrink NYCHAâ€™s carbon footprint, and create healthy and comfortable homes that will withstand the challenge of climate change.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.5 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the cityâ€™s surrounding waterways. The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $15B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Program Management Office (PMO) within BEDC provides technical support to the project delivery teams.  Project Controls, Schedule Controls, Permitting Support, Sustainability Review, Cost Estimating, Specifications Oversight, and management of the enterprise Program Management Information System all fall under the purview of the PMO.   The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction seeks to hire an Administrative Project Manager (NM) for the PMO division, located in the Lefrak City office in Elmhurst, NY to support the optimization of the PMIS system.  Continuous improvement to project delivery is key to BEDCâ€™s success and forms the foundation of their core values of Safety, Client Service, Quality, Budget and Schedule.  In support of these core values, BEDC has developed comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that define consistent processes that each project must adhere to. Organizationally, BEDC drives ownership and oversight through a hierarchy of project focused Accountable Managers, Portfolio Managers and Capital Program Directors that are responsible for ensuring the successful planning, design, construction and closeout of their projects. Given the large number of projects requiring consistent processes and information, BEDC determined that a program-wide project and construction management information system was necessary. The objectives of the system are to improve capital project delivery by creating efficiencies in critical business processes, making information more readily available to stakeholders, streamlining efforts to setup and manage new projects and allowing for consistency in project performance management under one sustainable information technology support model.    This is an exciting opportunity to manage the development efforts and oversee the architecture of this system.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.5 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the cityâ€™s surrounding waterways. The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $15B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Program Management Office (PMO) within BEDC provides technical support to the project delivery teams.  Project Controls, Schedule Controls, Permitting Support, Sustainability Review, Cost Estimating, Specifications Oversight, and management of the enterprise Program Management Information System all fall under the purview of the PMO.   The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction seeks to hire an Administrative Project Manager (NM) for the PMO division, located in the Lefrak City office in Elmhurst, NY to support the optimization of the PMIS system.  Continuous improvement to project delivery is key to BEDCâ€™s success and forms the foundation of their core values of Safety, Client Service, Quality, Budget and Schedule.  In support of these core values, BEDC has developed comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that define consistent processes that each project must adhere to. Organizationally, BEDC drives ownership and oversight through a hierarchy of project focused Accountable Managers, Portfolio Managers and Capital Program Directors that are responsible for ensuring the successful planning, design, construction and closeout of their projects. Given the large number of projects requiring consistent processes and information, BEDC determined that a program-wide project and construction management information system was necessary. The objectives of the system are to improve capital project delivery by creating efficiencies in critical business processes, making information more readily available to stakeholders, streamlining efforts to setup and manage new projects and allowing for consistency in project performance management under one sustainable information technology support model.    This is an exciting opportunity to manage the development efforts and oversee the architecture of this system.

The Forestry Program Manager will be responsible for managing all facets of the Forest Management Program and staff, which is comprised of four regional supervising foresters who develop and implement large, complex forest management projects which are critical for long-term land management and water quality protection. The four supervising foresters coordinate all regional activities of the program and each have a team of foresters reporting to them.  In addition to the four supervising foresters, an environmental planner also reports to the Forestry Program Manager.   The Forestry Program Manager will develop and coordinate program priorities and goals based on the FMP and other guiding documents and manage implementation of said projects and goals.  The Forestry Program Manager will coordinate the work of the programâ€™s staff and support them in the implementation of forest management projects, contracts, and other strategies.    The Forestry Program Manager will analyze watershed level forest trends, and develop monitoring and response strategies to meet the desired forest condition(s).  The Forester will be responsible for the periodic updating of forest management plans.  The Forester must be experienced and familiar with forestry science, silviculture, best management practices and techniques and timber harvest administration.
