In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 45-day review of practices by brokers in the taxi industry. TLC-licensed brokers represent clients in the purchase or sale of a taxicab medallion. The review evaluated whether brokers violated existing TLC rules and recommended policy changes to identify and avoid potential broker conflicts and clarify brokersâ€™ duty to act in the best interest of their clients.

The unitâ€™s mission is to protect TLC drivers and medallion owners from unfair or misleading industry practices by TLC-licensed businesses.

The Analysts will collaborate with agency partners to promote sound business practices, and investigate violations of TLC rules and relevant local, state or federal regulations.  Building upon the 45-day review of broker practices, the analysts will evaluate other TLC-licensed businesses and undertake a comprehensive review of existing TLC rules governing TLC-licensed business conduct to identify areas where new regulations are needed to protect drivers and medallion owners.  The analysts will work with other divisions within TLC, including licensing, prosecution and external affairs, on any necessary revisions to the licensure and renewal process, assisting in investigation of rule violations by TLC-licensed businesses, and educating drivers of their rights when working with a TLC-licensed business.       Duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to: 	 â€¢	Design and conduct periodic, high-level reviews of business practices of TLC brokers and other business entities, such agents, fleets, high-volume for hire services, and technology service providers, to ensure compliance with TLC rules and relevant local, state, and federal regulations.   â€¢	Develop investigative plans and strategies based on tips about bad behavior and analysis of complaints data, as well as random sampling.  Monitor companies suspected of engaging in suspicious practices. â€¢	Serve as a subject matter expert in analyzing complex business practices, and analyze external factors impacting the financial stability of the industry (e.g., medallion lending practices).  Research the business practices of TLC licensed entities and evaluate risks to the industry.  â€¢	Conduct research and investigations involving examinations of records, interviews of subjects and witnesses, and on-site inspections, collaborating as needed with other agencies within the City. â€¢	Collect, verify, and analyze documents subject to audit, including TLC data, financial records, public assistance records, and other records derived from law-enforcement databases and City and State agencies.
